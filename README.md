# colorkit

A limited color map capability, implemented for use with the
[jupyterlab_geojs](https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/jupyterlab_geojs)
project. The logic and color-series data were copied mostly from the
[js-colormaps](https://github.com/timothygebhard/js-colormaps) project.
The initial version supports just one color series, a 'rainbow'
pattern.
